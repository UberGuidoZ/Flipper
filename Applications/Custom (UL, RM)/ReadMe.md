*****Unofficial FAP Store is here! [You gotta check it out at FlipC.org](https://flipc.org/)*****<br>
From [Aleksey Korolev](https://github.com/playmean) comes a quick and easy way to install FAP files
---

Thank you [RogueMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster) and [xMasterX](https://github.com/xMasterX) for compiling and maintaining many of these files. I have decided to not include the "integrated/bundled" FAP files that come with a fresh install of Unleashed. If you need to grab a copy of them for whatever reason, you can do so right from the Unleashed repo.

* Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware) of the Unleashed repo.
* Scroll down and download the linked ZIP file from the Assets drop down, under the big install from web link.
* Within that ZIP, you'll find `resources.tar` - open/extract that too and look in the `apps` folder.

## Thank you to the authors

The Flipper and its community wouldn't be as rich as it is without your contributions and support. Thank you for all you have done. [MORE HERE](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware#community-apps-included)
