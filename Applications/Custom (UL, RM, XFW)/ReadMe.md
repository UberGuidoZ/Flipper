# Flipper Application Files (FAPs) for custom firmwares
* [Unleashed](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware)
* [Xtreme (ClaraCrazy)](https://github.com/ClaraCrazy/Flipper-Xtreme/)
* [RogueMaster](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins)

## [Download all files here](https://uberguidoz.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Applications/Custom%20(UL%2C%20RM%2C%20XFW)) (may not include [bundled apps](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware#community-apps-included)) or [source here](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/tree/main/Applications/Official/DEV_FW/source)<br>
[They are also hosting a copy of the extra files here](https://github.com/xMasterX/unleashed-extra-pack).

Thank you [xMasterX](https://github.com/xMasterX) for compiling and maintaining these files. I have decided to not include the "integrated/bundled" FAP files that come with a fresh install of Unleashed. If you need to grab a copy of them for whatever reason, you can do so right from the Unleashed repo.

* Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware) of the Unleashed repo.
* Scroll down and download the linked ZIP file from the Assets drop down, under the big install from web link.
* Within that ZIP, you'll find `resources.tar` - open/extract that too and look in the `apps` folder.

## Thank you to the authors!

The Flipper and its community wouldn't be as rich as it is without your contributions and support. Thank you for all you have done. [MORE HERE](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware#community-apps-included)
