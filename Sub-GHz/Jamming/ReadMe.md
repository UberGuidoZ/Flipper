# WARNING ABOUT JAMMING - This is probably illegal to do.

 These files are for educational use to determine ways the Flipper can work, how jamming works, and reviewing preventative actions.<br>

## United States

The use of a phone jammer, GPS blocker, or other signal jamming device designed to intentionally block, jam, or interfere with authorized radio communications is a violation of federal law.  There are no exemptions for use within a business, classroom, residence, or vehicle. Local law enforcement agencies do not have independent authority to use jamming equipment; in certain limited exceptions use by Federal law enforcement agencies is authorized in accordance with applicable statutes.

It is also unlawful to advertise, sell, distribute, import, or otherwise market jamming devices to consumers in the United States.

The use or marketing of a jammer in the United States may subject you to substantial monetary penalties, seizure of the unlawful equipment, and criminal sanctions including imprisonment.

It can be a matter of life and death: Private persons using radio-jamming devices to interfere with emergency responder communication. And it’s on the rise.

For many it’s just a prank, but interfering with public safety communication is against federal law. In fact it is illegal to buy, sell, or operate a jamming device – an offense that carries with it fines of up to $112,000 per act and time in federal prison.

## UK

It is a crime to use any apparatus, including jammers, for the purposes of deliberately interfering with wireless telegraphy (radio communications) in the UK. 

The maximum penalty is two years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. See [section 68](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/36/section/68) of the [Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006.](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/36/contents)

If you manufacture, import or distribute jammers, you may be committing a crime. 

The Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Directive 2014/30/EU, which has been implemented into UK law by the Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2016 (S.I. 2016/1091), places strict requirements on all electrical and electronic apparatus placed on the market or taken into service in the UK. The requirements state that apparatus must not cause excessive interference.

Ofcom may take appropriate enforcement action, including prosecution, to enforce the EMC provisions. The maximum penalty convention under the regulations is three months imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. The courts can order forfeiture of stocks of equipment.

## CEPT Countries

What does it mean to be a CEPT country? Member Nations of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) all share the same amateur radio reciprocal licensing requirements. Amateurs are permitted to operate from most European countries without the requirement of obtaining additional licensees or permits. This also means they share the same laws regarding things like jamming. The full list of countries ([more info](https://www.ero.dk/588adab6-30ee-4724-ba3a-33be7909832e.W5Doc?frames=no&mid=0A27BE3B-3BBD-45BB-8569-BE6C35C74159&)) is:
