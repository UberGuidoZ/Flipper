If you've flashed firmware that doesn't seem to include the Music Player (but see it as an option), try creating a "music_player" folder on the SD Card (ext) and pop some tunes in! You can use RTTTL (in TXT format) or FMF (Flipper Music Format) files.

**NOTE: Make sure to put the TXT and FMF files in the root of the music_player folder for them to work!**

If using subfolders, renaming TXT to RTTTL seems to work for some, though it stopped working for me. Sadly, that means no organization of music files as they all need to be in the root of the music_player folder. The various firmware devs are working on a fix. Otherwise, you can access them through the file browser on later firmwares.
