# Kyber Crystals

A how to program crystals from <https://sabersourcing.com/2019/10/30/kyber-crystal-rfid-hack-star-wars-galaxys-edge/>

1. Turn on RFID Reader/Writer (make sure it’s set to 125KHz). Hold the kyber crystal next to the device and click the “Read” button. The device will say “Read success” and recite the current RFID number of the kyber crystal.
2. Next, click the “Input” button. Enter the four digit number for your desired lightsaber blade color and dialogue set (see the complete list of RFID codes below). Press “Input” one more time.
3. Hold the kyber crystal next to the device and the click the “Write” button. If desired, use one of the option RFID key fobs instead of the kyber crystal itself. The device will say “Write success” to indicate that writing to the device worked.
4. Now you have reprogrammed the kyber crystal! Attach the kyber crystal to your Jedi Holocron or Sith Holocron to hear the dialogue of the reprogrammed kyber crystal. Alternatively, install the kyber crystal in your Savi’s Workshop lightsaber to view the new blade color.

Yoda (Magic 8 Ball) dialogue Green 3122 0000000C32
Snoke dialogue (note: this is from the black kyber crystal) Red 3123 0000000C33
I have been unsuccessful at unlocking or flashing any of the crystals or getting the flipper to emulate a crystal next to the saber in a way that changes the color. I have ordered some re-writable chips to create my own re-writable crystal. I will see if I have any success with them.

Here is a bunch of screenshots from <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZMBBxSc_ltAyheEVgKL4MpGfPc3iCjR1S6BEaavN40/edit#gid=1994856546>
