REM Creates a hidden folder named .phantom_audio in the home directory.
REM Writes a Python script (record.py) that uses the sox utility 
REM to record audio from the microphone and save it as a .mp3 file. 

REM Once executed, the audio recording will start and continue until manually stopped
REM You can stop the audio recording by finding the PID and using 'kill pid#'  
REM The recording is saved in the .phantom_audio directory under the home directory

REM To access the audio file easily, you can use the following steps:
REM Open a new Finder window. Go to the "Go" menu in the menu bar and select "Go to Folder"
REM enter "~/.phantom_audio" and click the "Go" button.
REM navigate to the .phantom_audio folder where you can find the "Secret audio.mp3" file.

REM To delete the hidden folder use command 'rm -r ~/.phantom_audio' 

REM Requirements: SOX you can install through homebrew 'brew install sox'
